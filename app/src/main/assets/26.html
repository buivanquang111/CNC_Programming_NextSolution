    <p>Here are cnc tool selection tips from a cnc machinist which will help you in cnc tool selection for your components in cnc machine workshop.</p>

    <p>Tool Selection for cnc machining is an art as cnc machine can do vast variety of operations like turning facing threading taping profile or arc machining.</p>
    <p>See the “Tool 1” in the image, If you have spent some time in the cnc machine workshop, you will suddenly say, oh! this is the type of tool which is mostly used in cnc machine workshop. Of course this is a general purpose cnc machine tool. This tool can be used for</p>
    <p>Now see the “Tool 2” this type of tool is not vastly used. What are the machining operations this tool can do</p>

    <p>What is the difference the “Tool 1” can do facing but “Tool 2” can’t do facing that’s all. If this is the only difference then why “Tool 1” is in vast use then the “Tool 2”. Actually the <strong>Main cutting edge angle </strong>makes the difference. No doubt the “Tool 2” works very well for the straight turning, we can take even bigger and deeper cuts if the machining diameter never changes, but if you try a steep taper ( machining from a smaller diameter to a bigger diameter) during machining then this tool is not a fit. On the other hand the “Tool 1” makes taper turning a joy. The same case is with profile or arc machining (if arc is steep).</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong> these are all my own thoughts, you may have a different opinion. But this all happened to me today, I just tried to machine a bigger arc with “Tool 2” and it refuses ( the job finish was not ok, and tool was giving a sound as it is rubbing not turning). The operation which I wanted to do was like this, I wanted to machine an arc with starting diameter of 40mm and end diameter of 98mm with 150mm arc length and the arc radius was 600mm and the component material was medium carbon steel. And the “Tool 2” really did very well when I just applied it to a straight turning diameter.</p>
