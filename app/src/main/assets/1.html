    <p>Although there are multiple CNC machine controls in use in cnc machine workshops like Fanuc, Haas CNC, Siemens Sinumerik etc.</p>
    <p>But for beginner level cnc machinists it is better to understand and start learning a cnc machine controls which is most widely used and understood, and almost every other cnc control has some similarities with such cnc controls.</p>
    <p>So Fanuc CNC controls has all such properties.</p>
    <p>Very simple to program, learn and understand.<br><img class="responsive-image size-full wp-image-5555 aligncenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="img/5.jpg" alt="How to Make CNC Program" width="350" height="220"></p>
