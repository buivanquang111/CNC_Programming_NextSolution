<div class="entry entry-content">
    <p>Today we will talk about cnc lathe machine jaws. You might read this post as an introductory article about cnc machine jaws. CNC machine jaws are used on a cnc lathe machine to grip the component in cnc lathe machine chuck.</p>
    <p>So the sole purpose of the cnc machine jaws is to grip the component in the cnc lathe machine chuck. Therefore almost all the cnc lathe machine jaws have almost same blueprint or you might say that normally all the cnc lathe machine jaws have the same shape and look.</p>

    <h2><span id="Jaws_Selection_a_CNC_Setter_Job">Jaws Selection a CNC Setter Job</span></h2>
    <p>Whenever a new component comes into workshop, CNC Setter have to select the jaws to grip that component.</p>
    <p>Sometimes cnc setter have those jaws (same cnc machine jaws can be re-used for component grip),</p>
    <p>but in some situations the component has a shape that is difficult to grip, so cnc setter have to tinker the cnc machine jaws,</p>
    <p>sometimes cnc setter have to weld some extra pieces with the standard shape jaws,</p>
    <p>and other times cnc setter have to machine the cnc machine jaws itself to make jaws to properly grip the required component.</p>

    <p>Normally cnc machine jaws has following properties</p>
