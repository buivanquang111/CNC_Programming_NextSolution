    <p>CNC lathe machine parts are very briefly with pictures are described earlier here&nbsp;<strong>CNC Lathe Introduction, Main Parts and their Functions</strong></p>
    <p>So now it is time to test what you have learned about cnc lathe machine parts, so let’s start</p>
    <h2><span id="Identify_CNC_Lathe_Machine_Parts_8211_1">Identify CNC Lathe Machine Parts – 1</span></h2>
    <p>Can you identify which cnc lathe machine part is shown in the picture below,</p>

        <h3><span id="Answer">Answer:</span></h3>
        <p>This is CNC lathe machine <strong>tool turret</strong><br>CNC tools are mounted on the cnc lathe turret for machining operations, tool are first indexed (in the cutting position) with a part-program command and then cutting with that tool is started.</p>

    <div id="answerDiv2" class="answerDiv">
        <h3><span id="Answer-2">Answer:</span></h3>
        <p>This is CNC machine <strong>control panel</strong><br>CNC part-programs can be added/edited/deleted through cnc machine control panel, cnc machinists control whole the cnc machine operation through the keys on this control panel. CNC control panel have many keys some for axis movements, spindle speed control etc.</p>
